These are the raw atlas configuration tables output from optimizer using the 
conf.toml file in this directory. This conf file approximates 3.26 mid-league 
economy. It is not valid for other economies and if anything is significantly 
different in another league you need to redo the numbers using release/optimizer.exe 
with the right config.
